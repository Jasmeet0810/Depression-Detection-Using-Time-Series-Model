# EEG-Based Depression Detection using Deep Learning Models

This project presents a comparative study of three deep learning architectures ‚Äî LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and Transformer ‚Äî for classifying Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) using EEG signals. The models are designed to analyze temporal brain activity patterns, perform robust classification, and handle variability and noise in real-world EEG data.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop and compare deep learning models for classifying depression using EEG time-series data.
  
- **Models Implemented**:
  - Long Short-Term Memory (**LSTM**)
  - Convolutional Neural Network + LSTM (**CNN-LSTM**)
  - Transformer with Self-Attention (**Transformer**)
    
- **Noise Handling**:
  - Variance-based feature filtering
  - Gaussian noise-based perturbation

## üìä Dataset Description

- **Input Type**: Resting-state EEG signals (64 channels)
- **Subjects**: Control and MDD-labeled individuals
- **Features**: Temporal, statistical, spectral, and entropy-based signals extracted from five brain regions
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Filtering (0.5‚Äì70 Hz), 50 Hz notch
  - ICA-based noise removal
  - Segmentation into fixed-length time windows
  - Standard normalization and feature selection
